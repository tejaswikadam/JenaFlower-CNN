Jena Flower 30 Dataset
-----------------------------------
This set contains flower images of 30 wild-flowering angiosperm species found on semi-arid grasslands around the city of Jena in Germany. Classes are represented by 11 to 70 images with a total of 1,479 images. Class labels and definitions for training, validation and test splits for three folds are included as text files.

The database was used in:

Data Splits
-----------------------------------
There are three separate splits as used in the papers. The results in the paper average over the three splits. Each split has a training file (trn1, trn2, trn3), a validation file (val1, val2, val3) and a test file (tst1, tst2, tst3).
The corresponding class labels are stored in the classlabels text file.
